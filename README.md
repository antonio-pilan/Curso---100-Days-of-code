 <h1>Hello!</h1>

Welcome to one of <strong>my learning repositories here on GitHub!</strong> Here, i sync my "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Bootcamp" projects. <br>

All projects are separated in different folders, one for each day, and there's Virtual Enviroments(windows version) inside each folder containing the needed packages for projects that demands more than base Python.<br>
<br>

Everything is Synchronized with GitHub as a way to also learn git frameworks, so i expect to be uploading here everyday untill it hits all 100 days.

<h2>How to look up for something</h2>

Each Python project have the name on it, but i'll set here all codes, then it'll be easier to find whatever you look for:
